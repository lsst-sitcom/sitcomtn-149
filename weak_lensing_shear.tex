\section{Weak Lensing Shear}
\label{sec:weak_lensing_shear}

Weak lensing shear measurements are planned to be carried out on a special-type of coadds namely the edge-free, cell-based coadds.
These require stacking sufficiently large number of exposures without any chip gaps or artifacts within a chosen small region (cell) in the sky.
Current set of science observations taken do not have the required depth or area to produce such coadds.

Instead, since the accuracy of PSF modeling is a primary concern for weak lensing, members of the Weak Lensing Shear Science Unit have focussed their efforts on the the delivered image quality and PSF \ref{sec:delivered_image_quality_and_psf}.
