\section{Difference Image Analysis: Transience and Variable Objects}
\label{sec:dia_transient_variable}


\subsection{DIA Status}

As we have started to obtain repeated science-quality images of some fields, we have begun to build coadded templates as part of the regular weekly cumulative Data Release Processings. 
These mini-DRPs also include difference image analysis (DIA) of their constituent exposures.
Using the DRP-produced templates, we have also obtained near-real-time difference images in Prompt Processing for a few exposures. 
We have not yet had the opportunity to begin tuning template generation, difference imaging, or Real/Bogus characterization of these data, so the report below provides an initial rough characterization of DIA performance. 

\subsection{ML Reliability and Artifact Rates}

We ran a convolutional neural network on 51$\times$51 difference, science, and template cutouts for 912k DIASources identified in the \texttt{w\_2024\_47} data release processing.  
This processing primarily includes data from extragalactic deep fields.
These DiaSources were obtained from 4252 detector-visit images, implying an average of 21 DIASources per detector or about four thousand per equivalent full LSST focal plane.
This is somewhat less than the ten thousand DIASources expected per visit and may reflect lower sensitivity due to ongoing image quality refinement and early templates.

The CNN was trained on simulated DC2 images with additional point source injection, so caution is needed when interpreting the values returned by this classifier on ComCam data.
Nevertheless,  Figure \ref{fig:reliability_hist} shows a clear separation in reliability scores and would imply roughly a 3:1 bogus:real ratio if taken at face value.
These values will be confirmed with manual inspection.
We plan to train a purpose-built classifier on larger samples of labeled ComCam data.
