\subsection{Synthetic Source Injection}

We used synthetic source injection of stars and galaxies to measure catalog completness and reliability.
\figRef{ssi_comp} shows an example figure showing i-band completness and purity as a function of magnitude for ECDFS (tract=5603).

We also confirmed a strategy to use twilight observations to verify the system can accurately observe bright stars (1 mag brighter than 15 saturation lim).
