This update on astrometry quality is based on data collected halfway through the \ComCam observations. It is important to note that so far only single frame astrometric calibration is being done. Doing the additional global astrometric calibration with GBDES will further improve the results presented here.


For now, metrics like AM1 (the RMS of distances between star pairs separated by 5â€™ across all visits on a tract) appear to be satisfactory. On average, the median value across different filters is around 10 mas, as shown in \figRef{AM1_plot}.

When examining the average astrometric residuals projected across the focal plane, some structures appear to be present, as in the example below in \figRef{fov_astrometry_plot}. However, more data is needed to confirm whether these patterns are noise or systematic effects. It is likely that GBDES will help address these structures once it is activated.
