\section{Difference Image Analysis: Solar System Objects}
\label{sec:dia_solar_system}

There is no difference image analysis of solar system objects because there are no difference images in which known or new solar system objects have been found.

Ten images taken on 2024-11-06 in the same field close to the ecliptic were ideal for asteroid association. Across the ten images, 24 known asteroids (all main belt asteroids with high-precision ephemerides) were detected and labeled, in 8 images per object on average. Failure modes included one object near the limiting magnitude which was detected in some but not all images and two objects which travelled near bright stars on which the deblender did not run, precluding their detection in the source catalog. The dimmest object had an ephemeris magnitude of V ~ 23.3.
