Five images were taken of the globular cluster 47 Tuc during early AOS testing (\eg \figRef{47Tuc}),
but while this field is a good target for testing the crowded field pipeline, these observations
are out of focus. 
Deblending failed on these images, and we are waiting on new data under better conditions to test deblending and image differencing.

Other fields observed so far have not exceeded \( 25\,000 \) sources per square degree, which is insufficient for testing the crowded field pipelines.
