\subsubsection{Observations taken to date}
Five visits of the globular cluster 47 Tuc were taken during AOS testing:

Links are to focal plane images of each visit.

This field is a good target for testing the crowded field pipeline, though these observations do not have a sufficiently good PSF for analysis. Zoomed in, the PSF of the stars in the cluster are a variety of \href

Deblending failed on these images, and we are waiting on new data under better conditions to test deblending and image differencing.

Other fields observed so far have not exceeded \( 25\,000 \) sources per square degree, which is insufficient for testing the crowded field pipelines.

\subsubsection{Commissioning data needed}
The ideal test data would be observations with densities in the \( 75\,000 - 100\,000 \) sources per square degree range. Several fields have been proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Extragalactic Deep Field:} Extended Chandra Deep Field-South @ (ra, dec) = (53.125, -28.1)
\item \textbf{Extragalactic Deep Field:} Euclid Deep Field South @ (ra, dec) = (59.1004, -48.73)
\item \textbf{Ecliptic Field:} Rubin\_SV\_38\_7 @ (ra, dec) = (37.9, 7.0)
\item \textbf{High Stellar Density:} Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy @ (ra, dec) = (40.00, -34.45)
\item \textbf{High Stellar Density:} Rubin\_SV\_095\_-25 @ (ra, dec) = (95.0, -25.0)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Development work needed}
While difference images can usually rely on having isolated diaSources, we expect to have many blended footprints in sufficiently crowded fields. 

We have implemented deblending of blends of purely positive or purely negative peaks (\href{https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-44319}{DM-44319}), but blends of mixed peaks require new development.
This work is ticketed on \href{https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-44416}{DM-44416}, but not yet started or planned.
