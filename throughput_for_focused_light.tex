\section{Throughput for Focused Light}
\label{sec:throughout_for_focused_light}

The ComCam throughput has been estimated in ugriz using FGCM and is discussed in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:photometric_calbration}.

\subsection{Collimated Beam Projector Status}

The Collimated Beam Projector (CBP) and Ekspla tunable laser were both installed on the dome during the week of November 18. See Figs.~\ref{fig:cbp_1, fig:cbp_2, fig:laser} figThey will both be connected to ethernet and a laser interlock system will be installed. First photon from the CBP is projected for December 2.
